# Seminar (first session)

This session will show the most basic aspects of [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

## Basic example

We will start with the [cannonical basic HTML A-Frame scene](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/):

* [Basic scene source code](https://github.com/jgbarah/aframe-playground/tree/master/seminar-01/basic.html)
* [View online](basic.html)

## Basic working environment

To work confortably, we will use some tools:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or the free version [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
* The [LiveServer extension for VSCode or VSCodium](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/)
    * Launch it as an HTTPS server. For that, you need to configure a certificate.
    You can use these self-signed certificates that we produced for the [BabiaXR project](https://babiaxr.gitlab.io): [babia_cert.pem](babia_cert.pem), [babia_key.pem](babia_key.pem). For that, download the two files somewhere in your filesystem, and configure LiveServer to use them.
