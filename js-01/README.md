## Building a scene with JavaScript

Let's work in `js-01`, creating a scene from scratch using
JavaScript. In other words, in HTML will have only an
`a-scene` element, and a JS script that, when the HTML
document is loaded in the browser, injects the rest of the
scene in the DOM, as children of `a-secene`.

### Results

Check the resulting [virtual reality scene](scene1.html).
